# jfx-fishtank
This is a repository containing a JavaFX project simulating a fish tank or home aquarium. Functionality includes adding to and removing fish from the tank.

# How does it work?
The user is first met with an empty tableview when the JavaFX app is booted. The user can then select to either add in fish to the tank or remove fish from the tank. Fish are added and removed by species or type. If one fish type is already in the table for example, its number is incremented upon adding instead of being added as another element in the table. In removing, the number is decremented from that fish, and once if it reaches 0, its element is fully removed.
